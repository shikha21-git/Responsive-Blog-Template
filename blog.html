        <p class="font1">Most people assume that they need to understand the origins of their low self-esteem to improve
            it. <br>
            And while it’s true that unpacking the original cause of your low self-esteem can be helpful to an extent,
            the more important insight is this:

            Whatever caused your low self-esteem in the past, it’s your present habits that are maintaining it. <br>
            n my work as a therapist, by far the biggest reason I see people struggle with low self-esteem is that they
            are caught in subtle mental habits that keep them feeling bad about themselves.
            <br>
            If you can learn to identify and overcome these four mental habits, you’ll find your self-esteem is actually
            much higher than you realize.
            <br>
        <h3>1. Dwelling on past mistakes</h3>
        <br>
        Of course, we all make mistakes. And when we do, it’s normal to feel bad about it:

        We fail to catch simple errors in our work and feel disappointed with ourselves.
        We say something insensitive at a dinner party and feel embarrassed afterward.
        Sometimes we even fail outright: not passing an exam or even getting fired from a job for poor performance and
        feeling like a failure.
        Now, some amount of thinking about and reflecting on our mistakes is healthy and good for our self-esteem
        because it helps us avoid similar mistakes in the future:
        <br>
        If you failed a test, it’s probably worth asking yourself why so that you can prepare better next time and learn
        from that failure.
        If your marriage “fails” because you were consumed with work and never spent quality time with your spouse, it’s
        probably worth reflecting on that if you want future relationships to go better.
        <br>
        <h3>2. Worrying about the future</h3>
        <br>
        Worrying about the future is another mental habit that feels productive but is actually harmful to both your
        emotional wellbeing and self-esteem.

        Here’s the key distinction to keep in mind:

        Planning for realistic dangers is very different than worrying about unrealistic ones.

        Our imagination is a powerful tool. But like most powerful tools, it can be used well or poorly…

        Imagining how you might enjoy working in a new career can help you grow and explore new professional options.
        But imagining all the ways you’re likely to fail in any new endeavor will make you anxious and depress your
        self-esteem.
        Imagining what would happen if you lost power while on a trip to the cabin for a weekend get-away might help you
        plan ahead and bring extra flashlights, water, and other supplies that might be helpful. But imagining you and
        your family getting into a car accident driving to the cabin will likely make you anxious and insecure.
